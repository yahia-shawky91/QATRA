# QATRA
An AI-powered smart water management system that monitors real-time consumption for households, industries, and agriculture. Using IoT sensors and AI analytics, it detects leaks, optimizes irrigation, reduces waste and integrates with smart payment systems to ensure sustainable water usage.


# Project Idea
A national AI-powered smart water management system designed to reduce water waste, optimize irrigation, and monitor real-time consumption.
The system integrates:

1- Mobile app for citizens, farmers, industries and authorities.

2- IoT sensors to detect leaks, measure soil moisture, and track water flow.

3- AI algorithms to optimize agricultural irrigation and predict abnormal consumption.

4- Smart payment integration for seamless billing.

5- Strong customer support system to ease commmunication between citizens and authority.

By combining AI, IoT and Big Data, the project provides a sustainable, efficient, and scalable solution to tackle Egyptâ€™s water scarcity challenge.


# Vision
To create a sustainable future where every drop of water is efficiently managed, conserved, and valued through AI-powered innovation, ensuring water security for generations to come.


# Mission
