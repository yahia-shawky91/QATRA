# QATRA
An AI-powered smart water management system that monitors real-time consumption for households, industries, and agriculture. Using IoT sensors and AI analytics, it detects leaks, optimizes irrigation, reduces waste, tracks wastewater recycling, and integrates with smart payment systems to ensure sustainable water usage.


# Project Idea
A national AI-powered smart water management system designed to reduce water waste, optimize irrigation, and monitor real-time consumption.
The system integrates:

1- Mobile app for citizens, farmers, and industries.

2- IoT sensors to detect leaks, measure soil moisture, and track water flow.

3- AI algorithms to optimize agricultural irrigation and predict abnormal consumption.

4- Smart payment integration for seamless billing.

5- Wastewater monitoring to enhance recycling and reuse.

By combining AI, IoT, and Big Data, the project provides a sustainable, efficient, and scalable solution to tackle Egyptâ€™s water scarcity challenge.

# Project Target
1- Reduce water waste and detect leaks early.

2- Optimize irrigation using AI and IoT sensors.

3- Monitor real-time water consumption for households, industries, and agriculture.

4- Integrate with smart payment and billing systems.

5- Track and improve wastewater recycling and reuse.

6- Build a centralized national database for water management.

7- Support sustainable and efficient water resource usage.
